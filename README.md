(a) BASIC I/O OPERATIONS – JAIGANESH.cpp

AIM
To perform basic input and output operations in C++.

APPARATUS
PC/Laptop with C++ compiler, text editor/IDE, terminal/console.

THEORY
C++ uses input and output streams for data handling. cin is used for input and cout is used for output. getline() can be used for line-based input.

ALGORITHM

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare variables for storing input.

Display message to the user using output statement.

Read input from the user using input statement.

Display the entered input using output statement.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION
Basic input and output operations are successfully performed in C++.

(b) BASIC CALCULATOR – CALCULATOR.cpp

AIM
To implement a basic calculator program in C++ to perform arithmetic operations.

APPARATUS
PC/Laptop with C++ compiler, text editor/IDE, terminal/console.

THEORY
C++ provides arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. A control structure like if-else or switch is used for operation selection.

ALGORITHM

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Declare variables for operands and operator.

Accept the first number from the user.

Accept the operator from the user.

Accept the second number from the user.

Use control structure to perform the chosen arithmetic operation.

Display the result.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION
A basic calculator program is implemented successfully using C++.
